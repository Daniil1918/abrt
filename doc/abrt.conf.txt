NAME
----
abrt.conf - Configuration file for abrt.

SYNOPSIS
--------
/etc/abrt/abrt.conf

DESCRIPTION
-----------
'abrt' is a daemon that watches for application crashes. When a crash occurs, it
collects the problem data and takes action according to its configuration. This
document describes abrt's configuration file.

The configuration file consists of items in the format "Option = Value".
A description of each item follows:

DumpLocation = 'directory'::
   The directory where should 'abrt' store coredumps and all files which are
   needed for reporting. The default is /var/spool/abrt.

MaxCrashReportsSize = 'number'::
   The maximum disk space (specified in megabytes) that 'abrt'
   will use for all the crash dumps. Specify a value here to ensure
   that the crash dumps will not fill all available storage space.
   The default is 1000.

WatchCrashdumpArchiveDir = 'directory'::
   The daemon will watch this directory and call 'abrt-handle-upload' on files
   which appear there. This is used to auto-unpack crashdump tarballs uploaded
   via ftp, scp, etc. The directory must exist and be writable for 'abrt'.
   There is no default.

DeleteUploaded = 'yes/no'::
   The daemon will delete an uploaded crashdump archive after an atempt to
   unpack it. An archive will be delete whether unpacking finishes successfully
   or not.
   The default value is 'no'.

DebugLevel = '0-100'::
   Allows ABRT tools to detect problems in ABRT itself. By increasing the value
   you can force ABRT to detect, process and report problems in ABRT. You have
   to bare in mind that ABRT might fall into an infinite loop when handling
   problems caused by itself.
   The default is 0 (non debug mode).

AutoreportingEvent = 'event'::
   A name of event which is run automatically after problem's detection. The
   event should perform some fast analysis and exit with 70 if the
   problem is known.
   Default is report_uReport.

AutoreportingEnabled = 'yes/no'::
   Enables automatic running of the event configured in AutoreportingEvent option.

ShortenedReporting = 'yes/no'::
   Enables shortened GUI reporting where the reporting is interrupted after
   AutoreportingEvent is done.
   Default is Yes if application is running in GNOME desktop session; otherwise
   No.

ExploreChroots = 'true/false'::
   Enables various features exploring process's root directories if they differ
   from the default root directory. The folowing list includes examples of
   enabled features:
     * query the rpm database in the process's root directory
     * save files like /etc/os-release from the process's root directory
   Default is false.
